See also https://stackoverflow.com/q/44370853 - Since scrolling must be handled by `<body>` instead of `<html>`, `window.scrollY` doesn't work. - Also due to `<body>` scroll, Safari's smooth scrolling doesn't work without special handling. - Doesn't work on Edge unless we apply a nasty hack: introduce a fixed-position element with top `z-index`. - https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/5084491/ - https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/ - https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing",
